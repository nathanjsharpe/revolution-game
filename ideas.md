- Wars (WW1, Japan)
- Reforms (farming, factories) - spend political capital to pass reforms, which would provide bonuses and slightly change game mechanics
- Professed vs actual faction - state faction could use secret police to infiltrate factions or convince people to become police informers, which would happen without knowledge of player
- Okhrana (secret police) & infiltration
- Imprisonment, Exile - could imprison or exile people with political points; being in prison or exile would limit what a person can do; e.g., could still write books in exile but couldn't influence gov't reform
- Assassination, Execution - removes person from game, maybe makes them a martyr - would require ruthlessness
