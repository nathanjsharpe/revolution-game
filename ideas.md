Comrade

# Winning
Different factions have different goals.

Proletariat revolution could be triggered by unrest level of population reaching a certain point or by spending points on certain actions. Game would change based on whether government is stable or unstable. In stable periods, factions attempt to foment revolution, prepare for next revolution. In revolutionary periods, attempt to wrest control of governement or force through certain policies.

# Events
Historical events would happen at appropriate times throughout the game. These could change the mechanics of the game or add actions. Examples: famines, war with Japan, WWI

# People
People start either as free agents or in default faction, can be recruited (propagandized) into other factions. People enter the game when they turn a certain age (based on historical birthdate). They leave the game when they die (of natural causes or are assassinated/executed).

# Mechanics
Turns would consist of 2 phases: earning points, spending points. People could take one action per turn (so could act either in earning phase or spending phase).
- Attributes & Skills
- Theory - earned
- Propaganda - spent to influence bourgeoisie, proletariat, or specific people
- Publications & Censorship - people can write books, books can be translated and published in russia (like marx), state can try to censor publication
- Wars (WW1, Japan) - would affect public opinion and faction loyalty. winning battles = bonus for state faction, being at war = penalty for Bolsheviks, SRs
- Reforms (farming, factories) - spend political capital to pass reforms, which would provide bonuses and slightly change game mechanics
- Professed vs actual faction - state faction could use secret police to infiltrate factions or convince people to become police informers, which would happen without knowledge of player
- Okhrana (secret police) & infiltration
- Imprisonment, Exile - could imprison or exile people with political points; being in prison or exile would limit what a person can do; e.g., could still write books in exile but couldn't influence gov't reform
- Assassination, Execution - removes person from game, maybe makes them a martyr - would require ruthlessness
